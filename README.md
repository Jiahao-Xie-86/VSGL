This project implements VSGL for graph property detection. It includes dataset preprocessing, model definition and training, evaluation, and utility functions to streamline the workflow.

Description of each file:
- **`main.py`:** Entry point for running the project.  
- **`train.py`:** Script for training the model.  
- **`model.py`:** The definition of the model.  
- **`utils.py`:** Utility functions used throughout the project, such as viualization function.  
- **`dataset.py`:** Manages dataset loading and preprocessing.
- **`dataset.zip`:** All the datasets used in our experiments are included here.  
- **`baselines/`:** Directory for baseline implementations. including the VN-Solver, Graphormer, Naive bayes and Random baseline.
